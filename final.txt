	There are some weird rumors in the city lately about the Devil General. Some say he wants to rebel against the king and rule the kingdom by himself, but you never really cared much
about them. The last task of the contest was about to be announced when suddenly...

General: I've been watching your evolution for some time, young man. You remind me of my young self... 

Eliott: Thank you, sir. 

General: That wasn't a compliment.

Eliott: Oh?

General: Allow me to rephrase. You have the capacity and enthusiasm to do great things, but you have really low life goals. Is it because you lack confidence or because of... something else?

	Before you could understand what he meant by "something else" , you notice something weird. Neither the king nor the other contestants were present. You knew you came a bit earlier
than you were supposed to, but at this point in time there was no way they were missing by choice. The General's troops were there, meaning something fishy was going on. 

General: You have *that* spark in you, but your blind loyality to the old man makes you waste your potential. I'm aware you won't join me, but for the sake of old hopes and dreams I'll give
	you a chance. Your last task, if you prefer to call it like that. Defeat me and everyone remains safe. Lose and everyone dies.
